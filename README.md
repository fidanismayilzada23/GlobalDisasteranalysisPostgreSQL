# 🌍 Global Disaster Analytics (SQL)

### 📊 Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive SQL-based analytical study** of **global natural disasters**.  
Using a multi-table relational dataset, it examines **environmental impact**, **economic damage**, **humanitarian response**, and **recovery outcomes** through **advanced SQL queries**, including **CTEs**, **Window Functions**, and **Comparative Indexing**.

The goal of the project is to derive **data-driven insights** that support **disaster preparedness**, **policy planning**, and **resilience improvement**.

### 🧩 Key Insights

#### 🔹 Regional Vulnerability & Exposure
- Identified **regions with the highest disaster frequency**
- Measured **total affected population** by country and continent
- Highlighted **long-duration disasters and slow recovery regions**
- Revealed patterns linked to **geography and climate zones**

#### 🔹 Disaster Type Impact Analysis
- Ranked disaster types by **economic damage and fatality severity**
- Highlighted **high-impact disaster categories** prioritizing emergency planning
- Observed long-term **ecological impact trends**

#### 🔹 Humanitarian Response & Relief Operations
- Compared relief organizations by **response time**
- Analyzed **volunteer involvement** and resource mobilization levels
- Found that **faster response correlates with lower mortality rate**

#### 🔹 Environmental Consequences
- Evaluated **CO₂ increase, air pollution, and water contamination** levels
- Calculated **forest loss** and **soil degradation severity**
- Identified environmental degradation as a **key recovery barrier**

#### 🔹 Economic Impact & Recovery Analysis
- Estimated **GDP loss percentage** and **recovery duration**
- Assessed **foreign aid effectiveness** and **insurance coverage**
- Found that **developing economies face longer recovery cycles**
